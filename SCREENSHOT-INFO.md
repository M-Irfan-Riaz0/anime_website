# Screenshot Required

WordPress requires a `screenshot.png` file for the theme to display properly in the admin.

## Requirements:
- Filename: `screenshot.png`
- Size: 1200 x 900 pixels (recommended)
- Location: Theme root folder (same level as style.css)

## How to create:
1. Take a screenshot of your homepage after setup
2. Resize to 1200x900 pixels
3. Save as `screenshot.png` in this folder

Without this file, your theme will show a blank preview in Appearance > Themes.
